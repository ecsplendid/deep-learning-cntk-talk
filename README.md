S2DS (science to data science) talk at Westminster University 14 August 2017
============================================================================

 

Material (slides and Jupyter notebook) for talk I did on CNTK and deep learning
on Azure.

 

Note; for a decent Jupyter notebook on using CNTK to build a CNN for MNIST,
check out CNTK_103D_MNIST_ConvolutionalNeuralNetwork.ipynb which comes installed
in the Tutorials folder in your CNTK installation.
